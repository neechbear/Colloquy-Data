This module munges the users.lua and lists.lua (Colloquy 1.3x) files
in to executable perl code which is then evaluated. Colloquy 1.4 uses
a seperate LUA file for each user and list, which are located in the
users and lists directories in the Colloquy data directory. These files
are read one by one and evaluated in the same way.

This module should therefore be used with caution if you cannot gaurentee
the integrity of the user and list LUA files! The module will issue a
warning complaining about write group permissions if ^W warnings are
enabled, and will die if any of the LUA files have world writable
permissions.
