NAME
    Colloquy::Data - Read Colloquy 1.3 and 1.4 data files

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Dumper;
     use Colloquy::Data qw(:all);
     
 my $colloquy_datadir = "/home/system/colloquy/data";
     
 #my ($users_hashref,$lists_hashref) = users($colloquy_datadir);
     my ($lists_hashref,$users_hashref) = lists($colloquy_datadir);
     
 print "Users: ".Dumper($users);
     print "Lists: ".Dumper($lists);

DESCRIPTION
    This module munges the users.lua and lists.lua (Colloquy 1.3x) files in
    to executable perl code which is then evaluated. Colloquy 1.4 uses a
    seperate LUA file for each user and list, which are located in the users
    and lists directories in the Colloquy data directory. These files are
    read one by one and evaluated in the same way.

    This module should therefore be used with caution if you cannot
    gaurentee the integrity of the user and list LUA files! The module will
    issue a warning complaining about write group permissions if $^W
    warnings are enabled, and will die if any of the LUA files have world
    writable permissions.
