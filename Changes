Version 1.15 - 29th May 2006
    + Changed to use Module::Build.

    + Added use of Safe module to prevent code injection
      through the evaluation of the Colloquy data files.

    + Changed unit tests to use Test::Deep instead of
      Test::Assertions

Version 1.14 - 6th February 2006
    + Modified Makefile.PL to be aware of automated testing
      environment variable and default to no to send usage
      information.

Version 1.13 - 12th January 2006
    + Fixed POD so that it actually passes the
      Test::Pod::Coverage unit tests, and fixed
      the unit test so that it actually tests the
      POD coverage since it wasn't before.

Version 1.12 - 12th January 2006
    + Tweaked unit test for 1.4 data to ensure
      that permissions are safe to begin with, and
      then force an insecurity to test the security
      trap.

Version 1.11 - 7th January 2006
    + Added Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage unit
      tests to make more compliant with CPANTS.

Version 1.10 - 30th December 2005

      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

Version 1.9 - 29th December 2005

    + Added GPL license header comment to various files.

    + Modified Makefile.PL to send anonymous information to
      http://perlgirl.org.uk/lib/usage.cgi if the user
      agrees. This is so I can track which of my modules
      are most heavily used and on what platforms, so I can
      concentrate on maintaning the most popular ones in
      my limited spare time.

Version 1.6 - 13th December 2005
    + Changed code to only read in files and ignore
      directories.

Version 1.5 - 8th December 2005

Version 1.4 - 28th November 2005
    + Added condition to catch known invalid user data files
      in colloquy when only the "return {" line is written
      because of case sensitive cruft in the colloquy code.

Version 1.3 - 12th November 2005
    + Fixed typo.

Version 1.2 - 12th November 2005
    + Updated the code to include carping and to actually
      do the permissions checking ;-)
